# NAME

ndctl-enable-region - enable the given region(s) and all descendant
namespaces

# SYNOPSIS

>     ndctl enable-region <region> [<options>]

# DESCRIPTION

A generic REGION device is registered for each PMEM range /
interleave-set. LIBNVDIMM provides a built-in driver for these REGION
devices. This driver is responsible for parsing namespace labels and
instantiating PMEM namespaces for each coherent set of labels.

# OPTIONS

\<region>  
A *regionX* device name, or a region id number. Restrict the operation
to the specified region(s). The keyword *all* can be specified to
indicate the lack of any restriction, however this is the same as not
supplying a --region option at all.

`-b; --bus=`  
A bus id number, or a provider string (e.g. "ACPI.NFIT"). Restrict the
operation to the specified bus(es). The keyword *all* can be specified
to indicate the lack of any restriction, however this is the same as not
supplying a --bus option at all.

# NAME

ndctl-enable-dimm - enable one more dimms

# SYNOPSIS

>     ndctl enable-dimm <dimm> [<options>]

# DESCRIPTION

A generic DIMM device object, named /dev/nmemX, is registered for each
memory device indicated in the ACPI NFIT table, or other platform NVDIMM
resource discovery mechanism. The LIBNVDIMM core provides a built-in
driver for these DIMM devices. The driver is responsible for determining
if the DIMM implements a namespace label area, and initializing the
kernel’s in-memory copy of that label data.

The kernel performs runtime modifications of that data when namespace
provisioning actions are taken, and actively blocks userspace from
initiating label data changes while the DIMM is active in any region.
Disabling a DIMM, after all the regions it is a member of have been
disabled, allows userspace to manually update the label data to be
consumed when the DIMM is next enabled.

# OPTIONS

\<dimm>  
A *nmemX* device name, or a dimm id number. Restrict the operation to
the specified dimm(s). The keyword *all* can be specified to indicate
the lack of any restriction, however this is the same as not supplying a
--dimm option at all.

`-b; --bus=`  
A bus id number, or a provider string (e.g. "ACPI.NFIT"). Restrict the
operation to the specified bus(es). The keyword *all* can be specified
to indicate the lack of any restriction, however this is the same as not
supplying a --bus option at all.

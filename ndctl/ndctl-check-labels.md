# NAME

ndctl-check-labels - determine if the given dimms have a valid namespace
index block

# SYNOPSIS

>     ndctl check-labels <nmem0> [<nmem1>..<nmemN>] [<options>]

# DESCRIPTION

The namespace label area is a small persistent partition of capacity
available on some NVDIMM devices. The label area is used to provision
one, or more, namespaces from regions. In addition to checking if a
label area has a valid index block, running this command in verbose mode
reports the reason the index block is deemed invalid.

# OPTIONS

\<memory device(s)>  
A *nmemX* device name, or a dimm id number. Restrict the operation to
the specified dimm(s). The keyword *all* can be specified to indicate
the lack of any restriction, however this is the same as not supplying a
--dimm option at all.

`-s; --size=`  
Limit the operation to the given number of bytes. A size of 0 indicates
to operate over the entire label capacity.

`-O; --offset=`  
Begin the operation at the given offset into the label area.

`-b; --bus=`  
A bus id number, or a provider string (e.g. "ACPI.NFIT"). Restrict the
operation to the specified bus(es). The keyword *all* can be specified
to indicate the lack of any restriction, however this is the same as not
supplying a --bus option at all.

`-v`  
Turn on verbose debug messages in the library (if ndctl was built with
logging and debug enabled).

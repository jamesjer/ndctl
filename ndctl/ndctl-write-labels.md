# NAME

ndctl-write-labels - write data to the label area on a dimm

# SYNOPSIS

>     ndctl write-labels <nmem> [-i <filename>]

# DESCRIPTION

The namespace label area is a small persistent partition of capacity
available on some NVDIMM devices. The label area is used to provision
one, or more, namespaces from regions. Read data from the input
filename, or stdin, and write it to the given \<nmem> device. Note that
the device must not be active in any region, otherwise the kernel will
not allow write access to the deviceâ€™s label data area.

# OPTIONS

\<memory device(s)>  
A *nmemX* device name, or a dimm id number. Restrict the operation to
the specified dimm(s). The keyword *all* can be specified to indicate
the lack of any restriction, however this is the same as not supplying a
--dimm option at all.

`-s; --size=`  
Limit the operation to the given number of bytes. A size of 0 indicates
to operate over the entire label capacity.

`-O; --offset=`  
Begin the operation at the given offset into the label area.

`-b; --bus=`  
A bus id number, or a provider string (e.g. "ACPI.NFIT"). Restrict the
operation to the specified bus(es). The keyword *all* can be specified
to indicate the lack of any restriction, however this is the same as not
supplying a --bus option at all.

`-v`  
Turn on verbose debug messages in the library (if ndctl was built with
logging and debug enabled).

`-i; --input`  
input file

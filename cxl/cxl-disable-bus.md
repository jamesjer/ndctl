# NAME

cxl-disable-bus - Shutdown an entire tree of CXL devices

# SYNOPSIS

>     cxl disable-bus <root0> [<root1>..<rootN>] [<options>]

For test and debug scenarios, disable a CXL bus and any associated
memory devices from CXL.mem operations.

Given any enable or disable command, if the operation is a no-op due to
the current state of a target (i.e. already enabled or disabled), it is
still considered successful when executed even if no actual operation is
performed. The target can be a bus, decoder, memdev, or region. The
operation will still succeed, and report the number of
bus/decoder/memdev/region operated on, even if the operation is a no-op.

# OPTIONS

`-f; --force`  
DANGEROUS: Override the safety measure that blocks attempts to disable a
bus if the tool determines a descendent memdev is in active usage.
Recall that CXL memory ranges might have been established by platform
firmware and disabling an active device is akin to force removing memory
from a running system.

`--debug`  
If the cxl tool was built with debug disabled, turn on debug messages.
